# Build — the post-approval conductor (router)

Opened the moment the user approves the plan (the approval gate lives in the operation discovery file — `DISCOVERY-create.md` / `DISCOVERY-connect.md`). This file is the **router, and it routes on FRAMEWORK-BUILD-CLASS** (`frontendBuild`), not on operation. It branches to the matching framework conductor, owns the two **(operation × framework) cell lookups** (bootstrap, wiring), owns the **shared release tail**, and owns the cross-cutting sections both framework conductors share (rate limits, the parallel diagnostic, the Final Message).

The **pre-approval** flow (operation routing, the Discovery questions, the plan + approval gate, the background scaffold + Designer dispatches that hide latency) is in `PLAN.md`; it hands off here on approval. The **Plan→Build contract** (`PLAN.md` § "The Plan→Build contract") — `operation`, `frontend`, `frontendBuild`, `verticals[]`, `designSource`, `brand` + the operation section — is held in orchestrator scratch and threaded into dispatch prompts. Build reads its install/build/release spine **purely off `frontendBuild`** (the core) and reads the operation-specific payload **only** at the bootstrap/wiring cells. Three cross-cutting rules referenced below — **Two tracks**, **Batching discipline**, and **User-facing output** — also live in `PLAN.md`.

## The run from approval — route on `frontendBuild` (framework)

The user just approved; the Plan→Build contract lives in orchestrator scratch (no disk snapshot is written). **Nothing is dispatched yet** — the funnel intentionally dispatched nothing so it could present the plan fast. Read `frontendBuild` from orchestrator scratch (resolved in Wave 0 / `DISCOVERY-connect.md` § 1.5). **On scratch loss**, recover it from durable disk: `@wix/astro` in `package.json` ⇒ `wix`; else `frontend: custom` — a `scripts.build` + a client bundler/framework dep ⇒ `own`, otherwise `none` (the same signal Discovery used). Then open the matching framework conductor — **read only that one**:

| `frontendBuild` | Framework class             | Conductor                                                                                                                              |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `wix`           | astro-native (`wix build`)  | **`BUILD-astro.md`** — Phase axis → run-steps 0–5 → Wave 3 → the build wave (merged Components + Pages per vertical) → Build & Release |
| `none`          | static HTML (no build)      | **`BUILD-own-build.md`** (none tenant) — install-skip → Seed → wiring → inline no-build release                                        |
| `own`           | own-build (`npm run build`) | **`BUILD-own-build.md`** (own tenant) — bundle `@wix/sdk` install → Seed → source-edit wiring → project's own build → release          |

Everything framework-specific (install, build command) lives in that conductor file. The **(operation × framework) cells** (bootstrap, wiring) and the **shared release tail** are below this line — both conductors point back here for them.

> **Build routes on framework, not operation.** `operation` (`create`/`connect`) already routed Discovery + Plan; it does **not** re-route Build. Build's only contact with operation is the two cells below (bootstrap, wiring), which read the operation section of the contract. The install/build/release spine is operation-blind.

> **Set the model tier on every dispatch.** Both framework classes dispatch subagents. Tier policy lives in `SKILL.md` § "Subagent model tier" — apply it by table lookup (the Phase axis table in `BUILD-astro.md`; the seeder/wiring rows in `BUILD-own-build.md`). The tier is selected via the dispatch primitive's model parameter, not the prompt; if you omit it, Default-tier roles silently run under-powered on the orchestrator's default model.

## The two (operation × framework) cells — bootstrap & wiring

Almost everything in Build is a 1-D framework switch (install/build/release, below). **Two** sub-steps genuinely need both axes — **bootstrap** (how the project comes into being) and **wiring** (how live Wix data reaches the frontend). Each is a small lookup over (operation × framework). The cell _content_ lives co-located with the conductor that runs it (read-isolation per `SKILL.md`); this section is the **seam map** — which cell resolves to where. Adding a framework (SPA) adds a row; adding an operation (extend) adds a column. No new phase files.

**Bootstrap cell** — how the working project is created before Setup:

|                          | `create`                                                                                                                     | `connect`                                                                                                                                                       | `extend` _(later)_                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **astro** (`wix`)        | `scaffold.sh <folder-name> "<brand>" --frontend astro` → `npm create @wix/new@latest headless` — `BUILD-astro.md` run-step 0 | —                                                                                                                                                               | add `.astro` + nav/home markers _(extend plan)_ |
| **own-build** (`own`)    | scaffold framework (`npm create vite`/…) → `init` — `BUILD-own-build.md` § "Bootstrap cell → create × own"                   | connection plan + `init` over brought source — `BUILD-own-build.md` § "Bootstrap cell → connect × own"                                                          | add to source _(extend plan)_                   |
| **none / html** (`none`) | —                                                                                                                            | `npm create @wix/new@latest init` over the brought HTML + fix `wix.config.json.site.outputDirectory` — `BUILD-own-build.md` § "Bootstrap cell → connect × none" | —                                               |

**Wiring cell** — how the frontend reads/writes Wix entities:

|                          | `create`                                                                                                          | `connect`                                                                                                                                                  | `extend` _(later)_                     |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **astro** (`wix`)        | write `.astro` pages with live SDK queries — `BUILD-astro.md` build wave (merged Components + Pages per vertical) | —                                                                                                                                                          | add `.astro` + markers _(extend plan)_ |
| **own-build** (`own`)    | write fresh data module (`@wix/data`) — `BUILD-own-build.md` § "Wiring cell → create × own"                       | rewrite source data-layer → `@wix/data` — `BUILD-own-build.md` § "Wiring cell → connect × own"                                                             | add to source _(extend plan)_          |
| **none / html** (`none`) | —                                                                                                                 | inject client-side `@wix/sdk` `<script type="module">` (additive, styled from the design's tokens) — `BUILD-own-build.md` § "Wiring cell → connect × none" | inject `<script>` _(extend plan)_      |

Reserved cells are single placeholders with a downstream-plan pointer — no empty files, no unexercised branches (the refactor's "crux" rule). Live cells: **astro-create** (in `BUILD-astro.md`); **connect-none**, **connect-own**, and **create-own** (in `BUILD-own-build.md`). Only the `extend` column remains reserved.

## Shared release tail (framework-blind)

Release is one step both framework classes share — it reads a single field (`outputDirectory`) and publishes:

1. **Build, if the framework has one** — `wix` runs `npx @wix/cli@latest build` (`BUILD-astro.md` § "Build & Release"); `own` runs the **project's own** `npm run build` then points `outputDirectory` at the build output (`BUILD-own-build.md` § "Release"); `none` has **no build** (the HTML is the deployable). **Never `wix build` for `own`** — that is astro-only.
2. **Release** — `npx @wix/cli@latest release`; extract the published URL from the `Site published on <url>` line. This also populates the **Frontend link** in headless settings natively. Transient release errors (`ECONNRESET`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `EAI_AGAIN`, `STATE_MISMATCH`, `temporarily unavailable`, `try again shortly`) — retry serially up to 3× with `attempt * 5`s backoff (`references/shared/PRODUCTION_SHARP_EDGES.md`). Do **not** retry build failures — those are code bugs to fix.

`wix release` is framework-tolerant: for non-astro frontends it deploys whatever `wix.config.json.site.outputDirectory` points at. The only framework difference is step 1 (whether/how to build); release itself is identical.

## Subagent rate / credit limits

Some runtimes apply per-session rate or credit limits to subagents. When a subagent return looks truncated, treat it as a rate-limit hit and recover.

### Detection

A subagent has hit a rate / credit limit when its return contains any of:

- Literal text `"You've hit your limit"`, `"quota exceeded"`, `"rate limit"`
- Total return under ~100 tokens with no fenced JSON block
- Return ending mid-sentence without a completion indicator

### Recovery procedure

1. **Check the subagent's declared output files on disk.** Each scope's reference lists the files it owns (e.g., the Phase 4 store-pages scope owns `products/index.astro`, `products/[slug].astro`, `cart.astro`, `thank-you.astro`, `ProductCard.astro`). Read each expected path.
2. **If all expected files exist on disk and look syntactically valid** (no empty files, no unterminated strings): treat the phase as complete and proceed with the next dispatch.
3. **If expected files are missing or empty:** retry the subagent once with an identical prompt. If the retry also hits the limit, decide per-case — the orchestrator may fall back to inline emission of the missing files if they're trivial (single-file scope), or fail the run.
4. **Do not loop.** Retrying the same subagent more than once after a rate limit wastes budget — the limit is session-scoped and persists.

## Diagnostic: did the concurrent batch actually run in parallel?

If a build feels slow, check whether dispatches that should have been concurrent actually overlapped in execution. Two failure modes:

1. **Serialized launch:** the orchestrator emitted subagent invocations one at a time across multiple turns instead of as a single batch. Symptom: multi-second gaps between subagent starts in the run log.
2. **Serialized execution:** the runtime dispatched the batch but executed it sequentially (rare; most runtimes parallelize properly).

The fix for (1) depends on the runtime — check whether your dispatch primitive supports a single concurrent batch and whether anything between the subagent invocations (status updates, narration, file writes) is splitting the batch into multiple turns. Even when (1) cannot be fixed, **background dispatch alone gives ~2× compression** by overlapping execution. Make every subagent that doesn't block downstream work a background subagent.

## Final Message — summary FIRST, then AGENTS.md, in ONE turn

**Ordering is strict and user-perceived latency depends on it.** The summary prose is the **first content of your final turn**; the `Write AGENTS.md` is the **last tool call in that same message** — so the user sees their live URL immediately, not after the file write.

Hard rules:

- **Do NOT write `AGENTS.md` before the summary.** Emitting the `Write` first (or in an earlier turn) is wrong even if the content is identical — it just delays the URL.
- **Do NOT emit a pre-narration turn** ("Site is live, writing the docs…", "delivering the summary…"). That is orchestration machinery (`PLAN.md` § "User-facing output") and it splits the single turn. The summary prose itself is the first thing the user sees after release.
- **One turn:** summary prose → then the `Write` tool call, as siblings in the same assistant message. The turn does not close until the `Write` completes, so the file still lands on disk before control returns.

The summary prose contains, in order:

1. **Production URL** — bold link, first line (the exact `Site published on <url>` string; do not retype it).
2. **Dashboard link** — `https://manage.wix.com/dashboard/<siteId>`.

**Do not present timings** — no total-wall figure, no per-phase breakdown, no "built in ~N min." The user wants their site, not a stopwatch.

Then, in the same turn after the summary prose, write the project-root **`AGENTS.md`** per `references/shared/AGENTS_MD.md` — a description of _what the site has_, composed from session scratch + `.wix/seeded.json`. Do not re-read anything to compose it.
